 # Jessica Atchley's Python Project: "ZRPG Character Creator"
<br>
 This project is meant to be a character creator for the website zrpg.net . This project will lead you through a series of questions, and depending on how you answer, the program will choose different attributes and characteristics for your rpg character. For example, the race of your character will be created through choosing an adjective. That adjective is tied to a specific race in the zprg world, and by choosing it, your character will be assigned that race. This project was made with Python and created by using various features learned through the Treehouse videos.
<br>
<br>

## Features that are included in this project according to the "3 required features" project requirements:
<br>

1. Create and call at least 3 functions, at least one of which must return a value that is used

  --> At least 4 functions are used in this program, for basic printing, changing the timing of printing, and pulling a name.

2. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application

--> The occupation is pulled from the jobs.txt file, and turned into a list which is then randomized. 

3. Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data

--> At least 3 different classes are made to seperate the different sections of the project

4. Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data

--> The dictionary that has been made and modified is displayed near the end of the program

5. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

--> A dictionary is created at the beginning of the program, with some values inside. During the course of the program these values are written over. In the case of "occupation", it starts as "nothing". This "nothing" is pulled out and displayed to the viewer, then changed to reflect the randomized occupation. 
<br>
<br>

## In addition, these requirements have also been met:

1. Project is uploaded to your GitHub repository and shows at minimum 5 separate commits
2. Project includes a README file that explains the following:
-A one paragraph or longer description of what your project is
-Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements
-Any special instructions required for the reviewer to run your project
3. Choose at least 3 items on the Features List below and implement them in your project
4. Your code has comments that document major sections of your code to make it easier to read
